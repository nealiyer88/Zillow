    "# Time Series Modeling: Forecasting Real Estate Prices in Zillow\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will forecast real estate prices for various zip codes using data from Zillow Research. As a consultant for a fictional real-estate investment firm, we have been asked to identify the **top 5 zip codes for investment** based on projected housing price trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task requires us to:\n",
    "- Preprocess the dataset.\n",
    "- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
    "- Build time series forecasting models (ARIMA).\n",
    "- Evaluate risk in terms of price volatility.\n",
    "- Finally, provide a well-rounded recommendation based on both forecasted growth and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in!"

    "### Step 1: Load the Data and Initial Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we begin by loading the Zillow housing data. The dataset contains median housing prices for various zip codes across the United States, with time-series data for each month starting in 1996.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also filter the data for a subset of zip codes of interest. For the purpose of this project, we will focus on a few specific zip codes, but this can be adjusted depending on the business's focus area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we'll check for missing data and duplicates to ensure that our dataset is clean and ready for analysis."
